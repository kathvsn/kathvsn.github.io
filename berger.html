      Something that I've never taken into account before is the "silence" of paintings and how words are used to manipulate the meaning behind a painting.
      I think this is something that is often overlooked by most people because when we see a painting,
      we don't know the context of it unless it is explicitly stated by the artist.
      If we see words surrounding a painting that describe it or if we hear an expert's interpretation,
      we will generally believe what is being presented to us; however, what is being said can totally be different from the original meaning.
      The paintings cannot speak for themselves as they are still and silent. With reproductions of artworks,
      adding things like movement, sound and words can manipulate the meaning behind a piece of art, making it ambiguous.

      A particular moment that stood out to me during the program was in episode four where Berger introduces the concept of publicity and glamour,
      and the appeal it has towards the public.
      He notes that publicity will persuade consumers with displays of transformations,
      which present the fabricated idea that one's life can be improved with purchases.
      This is done through advertisements,
      which are specifically designed and vocalized with the intent to create a false visionary standard which must be attained.
      People will envy you for your possessions and this state of being envied is what Berger says is "glamour."

      I thought this idea was interesting because it represents the globalization of mass consumer culture which has molded society.
      The simulated reality that is created from these advertisements enters our lives and thoughts and modifies our perception of what is real.
      For me I think this is representative of how individualism is lost as we become dissatisfied with ourselves,
      and we seek to mimic and mold ourselves after other people in order to feel content.
      This fear of not being envied or desirable is what drives publicity, and we can definitely see how this is prominent within our society today.
      It's been decades since the show was released and yet we can still relate to what is being said.
      I guess in some ways this is how the past still lives with us in the present.
