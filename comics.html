      In <i>Understanding Comics</i>, Scott McCloud gives insight into the world of comics and the history behind the art medium.
      McCloud notes that people fail to understand comics because their definition of what comics could be are narrow,
      and with that he goes on to present comics in a new perspective to help the audience better understand the medium.
      One of the points that McCloud makes about comics is that they are a medium that can hold any number of ideas and images.
      I thought that this was interesting because it shows how comics give a lot of freedom to the artists to express themselves
      within the content of these images and ideas. If we think about it, it's also a way for people to communicate these ideas
      that are beyond traditional methods.

      In Chapter 3, McCloud introduces this concept of "closure" which he says is the "phenomenon of observing fragments of
      something but perceiving the whole." He argues that closure allows the reader to connect the time and space offered by comics
      and mentally form them into a continuous, unified reality. I've never really thought about the reason why we are able to mentally
      visualize images and words and piece them together to form a scene in our minds, but after reading about the concept of closure
      it makes a lot of sense that we naturally interpret things according to the context that it is presented in. I think closure is
      one of the many ways that the reader participates and engages with the comic.

      Oftentimes art is viewed as a reproduction of reality, but this is not possible since art cannot truly capture the essence or experience
      of reality. Comics can, however, bring to light parts of reality that we do not otherwise observe. It's hard to convey senses and emotions
      through visual media but different art styles can evoke certain responses in the reader. In Chapter 5, McCloud explains how comics can represent
      invisible things like emotions and make them visible. He notes that the idea that a picture can evoke an emotional or sensual response in the viewer
      is vital to the art of comics. The example that McCloud uses is the representation of smell in comics. We can't see smell but when we see certain lines
      and features like flies for instance, we understand that it is meant to represent a "bad" smell. For me, this was a good example as to how small details
      like lines, shapes and colors can impact our understanding of art. They appeal to our senses  and can elicit certain feelings or emotions, and even give
      us an underlying meaning to the panel.
