        <h3 id="promoHeader">How Is Colorism Promoted By Cosmetic Companies?</h3>
        <p class="promoPara">
          Beauty standards have favored light skin for generations, but even worse, there have been extensive product campaigns geared towards lightening dark skin. Skin lightening products are both acceptable and profitable in many areas of the world.
          In advertising, the use of word association is important when it comes to attracting the interests of consumers. People looking to lighten their
          complexion will be drawn to companies and products that use words that are related to having light and "beautiful" skin. Common words used to advertise skin lightening products are fair, light, pure, pearl, snow, glowing, and brightening.
        </p>
        <p class="promoPara">
          Most of these lightening products promise this fabricated idea of beauty that comes with having a lighter skin tone, when in reality they are selling the idea that white is better. The colorism exhibited by cosmetic companies sends messages to darker
          skin toned people that they aren't as beautiful or important as someone with a lighter shade of skin. By creating that gap in their products, they fail to promote racial inclusiveness and acceptance.

              The effectiveness of advertising depends on how well a company can convince a consumer that a product can actually improve their appearance,
              which is why many cosmetic companies use light-skinned celebrities to endorse their products. Whiter skin is being marketed all over the world
              through models, actors, and music idols. These companies claim that their products are the secret to attaining the same skin tone of popular celebrities.

        <button class="collapse">The Illusion of Inclusion</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p class="collapsePara">
              When consumers see the lighter-skinned models and celebrities promote skin lightening products, they are under the impression that they too can look like them
              if they purchase the product and use it. Margaret Hunter calls the strategy of using light-skinned people of color in advertisements to lure in other people of
              color to try skin lightening products, the "illusion of inclusion."

        <button id="color3" class="collapse">Markets Matter</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p class="collapsePara">
              Cosmetic companies have a narrow perception of beauty, which they project onto their consumer markets abroad. When companies like Fair & Lovely became immensely popular
              in India for their skin lightening products, Western cosmetic companies were quick to join in on the trend and in hopes of imitating the same success abroad.
              Whether or not cosmetic companies choose to advertise the controversial products in the West would not make a major difference as the profitable market for skin
              lighteners lies in the East where Western culture and products are incredibly popular and eagerly accepted.
