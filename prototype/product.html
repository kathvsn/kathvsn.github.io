        <p class="prodPara">
          Skin bleaching goes by many names such as lightening, and whitening. They're often used interchangeably,
          but the purpose is universal: using products or undergoing procedures to reduce the amount of melanin, or pigment,
          in the skin. This can include the use of lasers, peels, creams, soaps, pills, and more. High demand for these products
          make it a profitable market, causing cosmetic companies to mass produce skin lightening products to supply this demand.
        </p>
        <p class="prodPara">
          Hydroquinone is the main bleaching agent that inhibits melanin production found in many skin lightening products.
          According to Evelyn Glenn, skin cancer, mercury poisoning and dermatitis were traced back to the excessive use of hydroquinone,
          which resulted in the ban of many skin lightening products in Europe in 2000. These products were not heavily regulated,
          so any toxins could be incorporated in the formulas and consumers would not have a clue about the dangers of using them. The ban of
          these skin lightening products caused consumers to use illegal means to attain them online.
        </p>

        <p class="prodPara">
          Major cosmetic companies that many are familiar with are L'Oreal, Lancome, OLAY, and Shiseido. While it is uncommon to see a diverse shade
          range coming from these companies, it is quite easy to find several skin lightening products from them. These skin lightening products are easily
          made available in drug stores and makeup stores. Not everyone who uses skin lightening products has the intention of changing their overall complexion,
          as these products are often used by people to treat hyperpigmentation, acne scars, stretch marks, and skin tone unevenness. For these users,
          prescription skin lightening creams are generally only allowed to be used under the supervision of a doctor.

          A majority of consumers who do use skin lightening products with the intent to change their overall skin tone complexion are people of color
          affected by colorism. They are blinded by the benefits of skin lightening, which causes them to ignore the health risks that come along with
          the harmful practice.
